>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>  Server Sent Events  <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
One Request, a very very long Response

What is Server Sent Events??    
    - A response has start and end
    - Client sent a request
    - Server sent logical events as part of Response
    - Server never writes the end of the response
    - It is still request but an unending response
    - Client parses the streams data looking for these events
    - Work with Request/Response (HTTP) "starting from HTTP 1.1"

Cons of Server Sent Events:
    - Client must be online
    - Client might not be able to handle
    - Polling is preferred for light clients
    - HTTP/1.1 problem (up to only 6 TCP connections!!)
