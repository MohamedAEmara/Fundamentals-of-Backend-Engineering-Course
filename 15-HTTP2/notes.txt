================== http 1.1 =================

client     ======================     server

in HTTP/1.1 Once a client sends a request the pipe is busy and you can't send another request in that pipe
after we get a response back, we can use the pipe for another request.


But in HTTP/2 you can send multiple requests in the same TCP connection (concurrently)



===================== HTTP/2 Pros & Cons =================
Pros:
    - Multiplexing over single connection (save resouces)
        You can combine more than one request in the same pipe
    - Compression (Headers & Data)
    - Server Push
    - Secure be default
    - Protocol Negotiation during TLS (ALPN)

Cons: 
    - TCP head of line blocking 
        I've sent some requests but TCP order them and if there's something wrong
        with segment1 none of the other requests will be processed.
        although they don't depend on each other.
    - Server Push never picked up
    - High CPU usage


HTTP/2 is faster than HTTP/1.1 because of Multiplexing
    - you can send many segments with the same request.
