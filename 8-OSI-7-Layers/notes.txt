What is OSI model?   7 layers each describe a specific networking component

    - Layer 7 (Application) 
        HTTP - FTP - gRPC
    - Layer 6 (Presentation)
        Encoding, Serialization
    - Layer 5 (Session)
        Connection establishment, TLS
    - Layer 4 (Transport)
        UDP - TCP "segment"  ==> every other layer 4 protocol is built on top of these two.
    - Layer 3 (Network)
        IP "packet"
    - Layer 2 (Data Link)
        MAC address Ethernet  "frames"
    - Layer 1 (Physical)
        Electric signals, fiber or radio waves




EXAMPLE: Sending a POST request to an HTTPS webpage:

- Layer 7 (Application)
    - POST request with JSON data to HTTPS server

- Layer 6 (Presentation)
    - Serialize JSON to flat byte strings

- Layer 5 (Session)
    - Request to establish TCP connection/TLS

- Layer 4 (Transport)
    - Send SYN request target port 443

- Layer 3 (Network)
    - SYN is placed an IP packet(s) and adds the source/dest MAC IPs

- Layer 2 (Data Link)
    - Each packet goes into a single frame and adds the source/dest MAC addresses

- Layer 1 (Physical)
    - Each frame becomes string of bits which converted into either a radio signal (wifi), electric signal(ethernet), or light(fiber)
