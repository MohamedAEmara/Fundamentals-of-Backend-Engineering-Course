What to take into account when designing a protocol?

What is a protocol?
    - a system (set of rules) that allows two parties to communicate.
    - a protocol is designed with a set of properties.
    

Protocol Properties:
    
    - Data format
        - Text based (plain text, JSON, XML)
        - Binary (protobuf, RESP "redis serialization protocol", http2, http3)
    
    - Transfer Mode
        - Message based (UDP, HTTP)
        - Stream (TCP, WebRTC)
    
    - Addressing system
        - DNS name, IP, MAC
    
    - Directionality
        - Bidirectional (TCP)
        - Unidirectional (HTTP)
        - Full/Half duplex
            wifi is "half duplex"   ==>  no two devices can send at the same time.

    - State
        - Stateful (TCP, gRPC, apache thrift)
        - Stateless (UDP, HTTP)
    
    - Routing
        - Proxies, Gateways

    - Flow & Congestion control
        - TCP (Flow & Congestion)
        - UDP (No control)

    - Error Management
        - Error Code
        - Retries and timeout
