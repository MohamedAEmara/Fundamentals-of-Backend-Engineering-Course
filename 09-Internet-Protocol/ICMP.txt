ICPM    ==>     Internet Control Message Protocol

- designed for informational messages
    - Host unreachable, port unreachable, fragmentation needed
    - Packet expired (infinite loop in routers)
- uses IP directly
- PING and traceroute use it
- doesn't require listeners or ports to be opoened

- some firewalls block ICMP for security reasons
- that's why PING might not work in those cases
- Disabling ICMP also can cause real damage with connection establishment (TCP black hole)
    - fragmentation needed




TraceRoute
    - Can you identify the entire path your IP Packet takes
    - Clever use of TTL
    - Increment TTL slowly and you will get the router IP address for each hop
    - doesn't always work as path changes and ICMP might be blocked
