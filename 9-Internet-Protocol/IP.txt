IP Address:
    - layer 3 property
    - can be set automatically or statically
    - network and host portion
    - 4 bytes in IPv4 - 32 bits


Network VS Host:
    a.b.c.d/x  ==>   (a.b.c.d are integers) , x is the network bits and what remains are host
    example: 192.168.254.0/24
    the first 24 bits (3 bytes) are network. and the rest 8 are for Host
    this means we can have up to 2^24 (16777216) networks and each network has up to 2^8 (255) hosts
 

Subnet Mask
    192.168.254.0/24 is also called a Subnet
    The subnet has a mast 255.255.255.0
        We used it to check if it's in the same network as me ==> send the mac address
        otherwise, you need to talk to talk to someone else who knows how to route this.
    t's used to determine whether the IP is in the same subnet


Default Gatway
    most networks consists of hosts and a Default Gateway
    host A can talk to B directly if both are in the same subnet
    otherwise A sends it to someone who might know, the Gateway
    the gateway has an IP Address and each host should know its gateway


Example: HOST 192.168.1.3 wants to talk to 192.168.1.2
    1- 192.168.1.3 applies subnet mask to itself and the destination IP 192.168.1.2 
        255.255.255.0  &  192.168.1.3   =   192.168.1.0
        255.255.255.0  &  192.168.1.2   =   192.168.1.0
    Same network, no need to route.

Example: host 192.168.1.3 wants to 192.168.2.2
        255.255.255.0  &  192.168.1.3   =   192.168.1.0
        255.255.255.0  &  192.168.2.2   =   192.168.2.0
    different subnet    ==>     The packet is sent to the Default gateway 192.168.1.100 





IP Packet
    - The IP Packet has headers and data sections
    - IP packet header is 20 bytes (can go up to 60 bytes if options are enabled)
    - Data section can go up to 65536
